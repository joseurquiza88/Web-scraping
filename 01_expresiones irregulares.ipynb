      "Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-IV. The utility and credibility of\n",
      "DSM-IV require that it focus on its clinical, research, and educational purposes and be\n",
      "supported by an extensive empirical foundation. Our highest priority has been to provide\n",
      "a helpful guide to clinical practice. We hoped to make DSM-IV practical and useful for\n",
      "clinicians by striving for brevity of criteria sets, clarity of language, and explicit statements\n",
      "of the constructs embodied in the diagnostic criteria. An additional goal was to facilitate\n",
      "research and improve communication among clinicians and researchers. We were also\n",
      "mindful of the use of DSM-IV for improving the collection of clinical information and\n",
      "as an educational tool for teaching psychopathology.\n",
      "An official nomenclature must be applicable in a wide diversity of contexts. DSM-IV\n",
      "is used by clinicians and researchers of many different orientations (e.g., biological,\n",
      "psychodynamic, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, family/systems). It is used by\n",
      "psychiatrists, other physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, occupational and\n",
      "rehabilitation therapists, counselors, and other health and mental health professionals.\n",
      "DSM-IV must be usable across settingsâ€”inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consulta-\n",
      "tion-liaison, clinic, private practice, and primary care, and with community populations.\n",
      "It is also a necessary tool for collecting and communicating accurate public health\n",
      "statistics. Fortunately, all these many uses are compatible with one another.\n",
      "DSM-IV was the product of 13 Work Groups (see Appendix J), each of which had\n",
      "primary responsibility for a section of the manual. This organization was designed to\n",
      "increase participation by experts in each of the respective fields. We took a number of\n",
      "precautions to ensure that the Work Group recommendations would reflect the breadth\n",
      "of available evidence and opinion and not just the views of the specific members. After\n",
      "extensive consultations with experts and clinicians in each field, we selected Work Group\n",
      "members who represented a wide range of perspectives and experiences. Work Group\n",
      "members were instructed that they were to participate as consensus scholars and not as\n",
      "advocates of previously held views. Furthermore, we established a formal evidence-\n",
      "based process for the Work Groups to follow.\n",
      "The Work Groups reported to the Task Force on DSM-IV (see p. ix), which consisted\n",
      "of 27 members, many of whom also chaired a Work Group. Each of the 13 Work Groups\n",
      "was composed of 5 (or more) members whose reviews were critiqued by between 50\n",
      "and 100 advisers, who were also chosen to represent diverse clinical and research\n",
      "expertise, disciplines, backgrounds, and settings. The involvement of many international\n",
      "experts ensured that DSM-IV had available the widest pool of information and would\n",
      "be applicable across cultures. Conferences and workshops were held to provide\n",
      "xvxvi\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "conceptual and methodological guidance for the DSM-IV effort. These included a\n",
      "number of consultations between the developers of DSM-IV and the developers of\n",
      "ICD-10 conducted for the purpose of increasing compatibility between the two systems.\n",
      "Also held were methods conferences that focused on cultural factors in the diagnosis of\n",
      "mental disorder, on geriatric diagnosis, and on psychiatric diagnosis in primary care\n",
      "settings.\n",
      "To maintain open and extensive lines of communication, the Task Force on DSM-IV\n",
      "established a liaison with many other components within the American Psychiatric\n",
      "Association and with more than 60 organizations and associations interested in the\n",
      "development of DSM-IV (e.g., American Health Information Management Association,\n",

      "cal Society, Coalition for the Family, Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry, National\n",
      "Association of Social Workers, National Center for Health Statistics, World Health\n",
      "Organization). We attempted to air issues and empirical evidence early in the process\n",
      "in order to identify potential problems and differences in interpretation. Exchanges of\n",
      "information were also made possible through the distribution of a semiannual newsletter\n",
      "(the DSM-IV Update), the publication of a regular column on DSM-IV in Hospital and\n",
      "Community Psychiatry, frequent presentations at national and international conferences,\n",
      "and numerous journal articles.\n",
      "Two years before the publication of DSM-IV, the Task Force published and widely\n",

      "of organizing and transmitting information in everyday life and has been the fundamental\n",
      "approach used in all systems of medical diagnosis. A categorical approach to classifica-\n",
      "tion works best when all members of a diagnostic class are homogeneous, when there\n",
      "are clear boundaries between classes, and when the different classes are mutually\n",
      "exclusive. Nonetheless, the limitations of the categorical classification system must be\n",
      "recognized.\n",
      "In DSM-IV, there is no assumption that each category of mental disorder is a\n",
      "completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries dividing it from other mental\n",
      "disorders or from no mental disorder. There is also no assumption that all individuals\n",
      "described as having the same mental disorder are alike in all important ways. The\n",
      "clinician using DSM-IV should therefore consider that individuals sharing a diagnosis\n",
      "are likely to be heterogeneous even in regard to the defining features of the diagnosis\n",
      "and that boundary cases will be difficult to diagnose in any but a probabilistic fashion.\n",
      "This outlook allows greater flexibility in the use of the system, encourages more specific\n",
      "attention to boundary cases, and emphasizes the need to capture additional clinical\n",
      "information that goes beyond diagnosis. In recognition of the heterogeneity of clinical\n",
      "presentations, DSM-IV often includes polythetic criteria sets, in which the individual\n",
      "need only present with a subset of items from a longer list (e.g., the diagnosis of\n",
      "Borderline Personality Disorder requires only five out of nine items).\n",

      "frequently accompanied by disturbed psychomotor behavior. Many individuals with\n",
      "delirium are restless or hyperactive. Manifestations of increased psychomotor activity\n",
      "may include groping or picking at the bedclothes, attempting to get out of bed when it\n",
      "is unsafe or untimely, and sudden movements. On the other hand, the individual may\n",
      "show decreased psychomotor activity, with sluggishness and lethargy that approach\n",
      "stupor. Psychomotor activity can shift from one extreme to the other over the course of\n",
      "a day. Impaired judgment may interfere with proper medical treatment.\n",
      "The individual may exhibit emotional disturbances such as anxiety, fear, depression,\n",
      "irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy. There may be rapid and unpredictable shifts\n",
      "from one emotional state to another, although some individuals with delirium have a\n",
      "constant emotional tone. Fear often accompanies threatening hallucinations or transient\n",
      "delusions. If fear is marked, the person may attack those who are falsely perceived as\n",
      "threatening. Injuries may be sustained from falling out of bed or trying to escape while\n",
      "attached to intravenous lines, respiratory tubes, urinary catheters, or other medical\n",
      "equipment. The disturbed emotional state may also be evident in calling out, screaming,\n",
      "cursing, muttering, moaning, or other sounds. These behaviors are especially prevalent\n",
      "at night and under conditions in which stimulation and environmental cues are lacking.\n",
      "In addition to laboratory findings that are characteristic of associated or etiological\n",

      "pathology and of the availability and timely application of effective treatment. The\n",
      "mode of onset and subsequent course of dementia also depend on the underlying\n",
      "etiology. The level of disability depends not only on the severity of the individual's\n",

      "B. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory\n",
      "findings that the disturbance is the direct physiological consequence of\n",
      "a general medical condition.\n",
      "Application of this criterion requires two separate judgments: that a general medical\n",
      "condition is present (ascertained by history, physical examination, or laboratory assess-\n",
      "ment) and that the disturbance (e.g., psychotic, mood, anxiety symptoms) is etiologically\n",
      "related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. Although\n",
      "there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the\n",
      "disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several considerations\n",
      "provide guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a temporal association\n",
      "between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical condition and that\n",
      "of the mental disorder (e.g., symptoms of anxiety in an individual with a parathyroid\n",
      "adenoma that resolve after surgical excision restores a normal serum calcium level).\n",
      "Although evidence of a close temporal relationship is often useful in making a judgment\n",
      "about etiology, there are many exceptions. For example, Psychotic Disorder Due to\n",
      "Epilepsy can emerge many years after the onset of seizures. Alternatively, symptomsMental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition\n",
      "167\n",
      "and signs of a mental disorder can be among the first manifestations of a systemic or\n",
      "cerebral disease, appearing months or more before the detection of the underlying\n",
      "pathological process (e.g., depressed mood preceding choreiform movements in\n",
      "Huntington's disease). Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition can also\n",
      "persist after the general medical condition has resolved (e.g., depressed mood persisting\n",
      "after thyroid hormone replacement). Moreover, a Mental Disorder Due to a General\n",

      "the general medical condition that alleviates the symptoms of both the general medical\n",
      "condition and the mental disturbance may provide stronger evidence of an etiological\n",
      "relationship.\n",
      "A second important consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of the\n",
      "primary mental disorder. The most common example is an atypical age at onset or course\n",
      "(e.g., first appearance of schizophrenic-like symptoms in a 75-year-old individual). There\n",
      "may be unusual associated features (e.g., visual or tactile hallucinations accompanying\n",

      "loss in an individual with otherwise mild depressive symptoms might suggest the\n",
      "presence of a underlying general medical condition). The clinician should be alerted\n",

      "association between the general medical condition and the phenomenology of a specific\n",

      "evidence suggests a possible causal link between a mental disorder and a particular\n",

      "information (e.g., medical records; a spouse, relative, or close friend). In addition,\n",
      "physical examination findings and laboratory test results can be helpful.\n",
      "Route of administration. The route of administration of a substance is an important\n",
      "factor in determining its effects (including the time course of developing Intoxication,\n",
      "the probability that its use will produce physiological changes associated with With-\n",

      "consumption patterns will be characterized by periodic binges or daily use). Routes of\n",
      "administration that produce more rapid and efficient absorption into the bloodstream\n",
      "(e.g., intravenous, smoking, or \"snorting\") tend to result in a more intense intoxication\n",
      "and an increased likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance use leading to\n",
      "Dependence. Routes of administration that quickly deliver a large amount of the\n",
      "substance to the brain are also associated with higher levels of substance consumption186\n",
      "Substance-Related Disorders\n",
      "and an increased likelihood of toxic effects. For example, a person who uses intravenous\n",
      "amphetamine is more likely to consume large amounts of the substance and thereby\n",
      "risk an overdose than the person who only takes amphetamine orally or intranasally.\n",
      "Speed of onset within a class of substance. Rapidly acting substances are more\n",
      "likely than slower-acting substances to produce immediate intoxication and lead to\n",
      "Dependence or Abuse. For example, because diazepam and alprazolam both have a\n",
      "more rapid onset than oxazepam, they may consequently be more likely to lead to\n",
      "Substance Dependence or Abuse.\n",
      "Duration of effects. The duration of effects associated with a particular substance is\n",
      "also important in determining the time course of Intoxication and whether use of the\n",
      "substance will lead to Dependence or Abuse. Relatively short-acting substances (e.g.,\n",
      "certain anxiolytics) tend to have a higher potential for the development of Dependence\n",
      "or Abuse than substances with similar effects that have a longer duration of action (e.g.,\n",

      "do not know the specific contents of what they have taken. Toxicological tests may also\n",

      "differentiate Intoxication from Withdrawal.\n",
      "The blood level of a substance may be a useful clue in determining whether the\n",
      "person has a high tolerance to a given group of substances (e.g., a person presenting\n",
      "with a blood alcohol level of over 150 mg/dl without signs of Alcohol Intoxication has\n",
      "a significant tolerance to alcohol and is likely to be a chronic user of either alcohol orSubstance-Related Disorders\n",
      "187\n",
      "a sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic). Another method for assessing tolerance is to\n",
      "determine the individual's response to an agonist or antagonist medication. For example,\n",
      "a person who does not exhibit any signs of intoxication from a dose of pentobarbital\n",
      "of 200 mg or higher has a significant tolerance to sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics\n",
      "and may need treatment to prevent the development of Withdrawal. Similarly, in cases\n",
      "in which opioid tolerance or Dependence cannot be clearly confirmed by history, the\n",
      "use of an antagonist (e.g., naloxone) to demonstrate whether withdrawal symptoms are\n",
      "induced may be informative.\n",
      "Laboratory tests can be useful in identifying Withdrawal in individuals with\n",
      "Substance Dependence. Evidence for cessation or reduction of dosing may be obtained\n",
      "by history or by toxicological analysis of body fluids (e.g., urine or blood). Although\n",
      "most substances and their metabolites clear the urine within 48 hours of ingestion, certain\n",
      "metabolites may be present for a longer period in those who use the substance\n",
      "chronically. If the person presents with Withdrawal from an unknown substance, urine\n",
      "tests may help identify the substance from which the person is withdrawing and make\n",
      "it possible to initiate appropriate treatment. Urine tests may also be helpful in\n",

      "In most Asian cultures, the overall prevalence of Alcohol-Related Disorders may be\n",

      "a male-to-female ratio as high as 5:1. However, this ratio varies substantially depending\n",
      "on the age group. Females tend to start drinking heavily later in life than do males and\n",

      "consequences as do males. Females tend to develop higher blood alcohol concentrations\n",

      "Prevalence\n",
      "Alcohol Dependence and Abuse are among the most prevalent mental disorders in the\n",
      "general population. A community study conducted in the United States from 1980 to\n",
      "1985 using DSM-III criteria found that about 8% of the adult population had Alcohol\n",
      "Dependence and about 5% had Alcohol Abuse at some time in their lives. Approximately\n",
      "6% had Alcohol Dependence or Abuse during the preceding year. From data collected\n",
      "prospectively, about 7.5% had symptoms that met criteria for an Alcohol-Related Disorder\n",
      "during a 1-year period. A United States national probability sample of noninstitutional-\n",
      "ized adults (ages 15-54 years) conducted in 1990-1991 using DSM-III-R criteria reported\n",
      "that around 14% had Alcohol Dependence at some time in their lives, with approximately\n",
      "7% having had Dependence in the past year.\n",
      "Course\n",
      "The first episode of Alcohol Intoxication is likely to occur in the mid-teens, with the age\n",
      "at onset of Alcohol Dependence peaking in the 20s to mid-30s. The large majority of\n",
      "those who develop Alcohol-Related Disorders do so by their late 30s. The first evidence\n",
      "of Withdrawal is not likely to appear until after many other aspects of Dependence have\n",
      "developed. Alcohol Abuse and Dependence have a variable course that is frequently\n",
      "characterized by periods of remission and relapse. A decision to stop drinking, often in\n",
      "response to a crisis, is likely to be followed by weeks or more of abstinence, which is\n",
      "often followed by limited periods of controlled or nonproblematic drinking. However,\n",
      "once alcohol intake resumes, it is highly likely that consumption will rapidly escalate\n",
      "and that severe problems will once again develop. Clinicians often have the erroneous\n",
      "impression that Alcohol Dependence and Abuse are intractable disorders based on the\n",
      "fact that those who present for treatment typically have a history of many years of severe\n",
      "alcohol-related problems. However, these most severe cases represent only a small\n",
      "proportion of individuals with Alcohol Dependence or Abuse, and the typical person\n",
      "with an Alcohol Use Disorder has a much more promising prognosis. Follow-up studies\n",
      "of more highly functioning individuals show a higher than 65% 1-year abstinence rateAlcohol-Related Disorders\n",
      "203\n",
      "following treatment. Some individuals (perhaps 20% or more) with Alcohol Dependence\n",
      "achieve long-term sobriety even without active treatment.\n",
      "During even mild Alcohol Intoxication, different symptoms are likely to be observed\n",
      "at different time points. Early in the drinking period, when blood alcohol levels are\n",
      "rising, symptoms often include talkativeness, a sensation of well-being, and a bright,\n",
      "expansive mood. Later, especially when blood alcohol levels are falling, the individual\n",
      "is likely to become progressively more depressed, withdrawn, and cognitively impaired.\n",
      "At very high blood alcohol levels (e.g., 200-300 mg/dl), a nontolerant individual is likely\n",
      "to fall asleep and enter a first stage of anesthesia. Higher blood alcohol levels (e.g., in\n",
      "excess of 300â€”400 mg/dl) can cause inhibition of respiration and pulse and even death\n",
      "in nontolerant individuals. The duration of Intoxication depends on how much alcohol\n",
      "was consumed over what period of time. In general, the body is able to metabolize\n",
      "approximately one drink per hour, so that the blood alcohol level generally decreases\n",
      "at a rate of 15-20 mg/dl per hour. Signs and symptoms of intoxication are likely to be\n",
      "more intense when the blood alcohol level is rising than when it is falling.\n",
      "Familial Pattern\n",
      "Alcohol Dependence often has a familial pattern, and at least some of the transmission\n",
      "can be traced to genetic factors. The risk for Alcohol Dependence is three to four times\n",
      "higher in close relatives of people with Alcohol Dependence. Higher risk is associated\n",
      "with a greater number of affected relatives, closer genetic relationships, and the severity\n",
      "of the alcohol-related problems in the affected relative. Most studies have found a\n",
      "significantly higher risk for Alcohol Dependence in the monozygotic twin than in the\n",
      "dizygotic twin of a person with Alcohol Dependence. Adoption studies have revealed\n",
      "a three- to fourfold increase in risk for Alcohol Dependence in the children of individuals\n",
      "with Alcohol Dependence when these children were adopted away at birth and raised\n",
      "by adoptive parents who did not have this disorder. However, genetic factors explain\n",
      "only a part of the risk for Alcohol Dependence, with a significant part of the risk coming\n",
      "from environmental or interpersonal factors that may include cultural attitudes toward\n",
      "drinking and drunkenness, the availability of alcohol (including price), expectations of\n",

      "on clinical judgment concerning the severity of negative symptoms, the nature and type\n",
      "of neuroleptic medication, the effects of dosage adjustment, and the effects of anticho-\n",

      "that enduring negative symptoms be referred to as \"deficit\" symptoms.\n",
      "Criterion A for Schizophrenia requires that at least two of the five items be present\n",
      "concurrently for much of at least 1 month. However, if delusions are bizarre or\n",
      "hallucinations involve \"voices commenting\" or \"voices conversing,\" then the presence\n",
      "of only one item is required. The presence of this relatively severe constellation of signs\n",

      "still be considered to have been met if the clinician judges that the symptoms would\n",
      "have persisted for a month in the absence of effective treatment. In children, evaluation\n",
      "of the characteristic symptoms should include due consideration of the presence of other\n",
      "disorders or developmental difficulties. For example, the disorganized speech in a child\n",
      "with a Communication Disorder should not count toward a diagnosis of Schizophrenia\n",
      "unless the degree of disorganization is significantly greater than would be expected on\n",
      "the basis of the Communication Disorder alone.\n",

      "is not given if the individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A\n",
      "for Schizophrenia (Criterion B). Auditory or visual hallucinations, if present, are not\n",
      "prominent. Tactile or olfactory hallucinations may be present (and prominent) if they\n",
      "are related to the delusional theme (e.g., the sensation of being infested with insects\n",
      "associated with delusions of infestation, or the perception that one emits a foul odor\n",
      "from a body orifice associated with delusions of reference). Apart from the direct impact\n",
      "of the delusions, psychosocial functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is\n",
      "neither obviously odd nor bizarre (Criterion C). If mood episodes occur concurrently\n",
      "with the delusions, the total duration of these mood episodes is relatively brief compared\n",
      "to the total duration of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions are not due\n",
      "to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., cocaine) or a general medical\n",
      "condition (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus) (Criterion E).\n",
      "Although the determination of whether delusions are bizarre is considered to be\n",
      "especially important in distinguishing between Delusional Disorder and Schizophrenia,\n",
      "\"bizarreness\" may be difficult to judge, especially across different cultures. Delusions are\n",
      "deemed bizarre if they are clearly implausible, not understandable, and not derived from\n",
      "ordinary life experiences (e.g., an individual's belief that a stranger has removed his or\n",
      "her internal organs and replaced them with someone else's organs without leaving any297.1 Delusional Disorder\n",
      "297\n",
      "wounds or scars). In contrast, nonbizarre delusions involve situations that can conceiv-\n",

      "deceived by one's spouse or lover).\n",
      "Psychosocial functioning is variable. Some individuals may appear to be relatively\n",
      "unimpaired in their interpersonal and occupational roles. In others, the impairment may\n",
      "be substantial and include low or absent occupational functioning and social isolation.\n",
      "When poor psychosocial functioning is present in Delusional Disorder, it arises directly\n",
      "from the delusional beliefs themselves. For example, an individual who is convinced\n",
      "that he will be murdered by \"Mafia hit men\" may quit his job and refuse to leave his\n",
      "house except late at night and only when dressed in clothes quite different from his\n",
      "normal attire. All of this behavior is an understandable attempt to prevent being identified\n",
      "and killed by his presumed assassins. In contrast, poor functioning in Schizophrenia\n",
      "may be due to both positive and negative symptoms (particularly avolition). Similarly,\n",
      "a common characteristic of individuals with Delusional Disorder is the apparent\n",

      "person about whom this conviction is held is usually of higher status (e.g., a\n",

      "which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all\n",
      "activities. In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. The\n",
      "individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that\n",
      "includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased\n",
      "energy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making\n",
      "decisions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation, plans, or attempts. To\n",
      "count toward a Major Depressive Episode, a symptom must either be newly present or\n",
      "must have clearly worsened compared with the person's preepisode status. The\n",
      "symptoms must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive\n",
      "weeks. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment\n",
      "in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals\n",
      "with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal, but requires markedly\n",
      "increased effort.\n",
      "The mood in a Major Depressive Episode is often described by the person as\n",
      "depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or \"down in the dumps\" (Criterion Al). In some\n",
      "cases, sadness may be denied at first, but may subsequently be elicited by interview\n",
      "(e.g., by pointing out that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some\n",
      "individuals who complain of feeling \"blah,\" having no feelings, or feeling anxious, theMajor Depressive Episode\n",
      "321\n",
      "presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's facial expression and\n",
      "demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic complaints (e.g., bodily aches and\n",
      "pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit\n",
      "increased irritability (e.g., persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry\n",
      "outbursts or blaming others, or an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters).\n",
      "In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad\n",
      "or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a \"spoiled child\"\n",
      "pattern of irritability when frustrated.\n",
      "Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree.\n",
      "Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, \"not caring anymore,\" or not\n",
      "feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion\n",
      "A2). Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations\n",
      "(e.g., a formerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds\n",
      "excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from\n",
      "previous levels of sexual interest or desire.\n",
      "Appetite is usually reduced, and many individuals feel that they have to force\n",
      "themselves to eat. Other individuals, particularly those encountered in ambulatory\n",
      "settings, may have increased appetite and may crave specific foods (e.g., sweets or other\n",
      "carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a\n",
      "significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains\n",
      "may be noted (Criterion A3).\n",
      "The most common sleep disturbance associated with a Major Depressive Episode\n",
      "is insomnia (Criterion A4). Individuals typically have middle insomnia (i.e., waking up\n",
      "during the night and having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i.e.,\n",
      "waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i.e., difficulty\n",
      "falling asleep) may also occur. Less frequently, individuals present with oversleeping\n",
      "(hypersomnia) in the form of prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime\n",
      "sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep.\n",
      "Psychomotor changes include agitation (e.g., the inability to sit still, pacing,\n",
      "hand-wringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation\n",
      "(e.g., slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answer-\n",
      "ing; speech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or\n",
      "muteness) (Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe\n",
      "enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings.\n",
      "Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may\n",
      "report sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to\n",
      "require substantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be\n",
      "reduced. For example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the\n",
      "morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual.\n",
      "The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a Major Depressive Episode may\n",
      "include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or\n",
      "ruminations over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret\n",
      "neutral or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an\n",
      "exaggerated sense of responsibility for untoward events. For example, a realtor may\n",
      "become preoccupied with self-blame for failing to make sales even when the market\n",
      "has collapsed generally and other realtors are equally unable to make sales. The sense\n",
      "of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportions (e.g., an individual who is\n",
      "convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself\n",
      "for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or interpersonal responsibilities as a322\n",
      "Mood Disorders\n",
      "result of the depression is very common and, unless delusional, is not considered\n",
      "sufficient to meet this criterion.\n",
      "Many individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make decisions\n",
      "(Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties.\n",
      "Those in intellectually demanding academic or occupational pursuits are often unable\n",
      "to function adequately even when they have mild concentration problems (e.g., a\n",
      "computer programmer who can no longer perform complicated but previously manage-\n",
      "able tasks). In children, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In\n",

      "marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or to require hospitalization,\n",
      "or it is characterized by the presence of psychotic features (Criterion D). The episode\n",
      "must not be due to the direct physiological effects of a drug of abuse, a medication,\n",
      "other somatic treatments for depression (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy or light therapy)\n",
      "or toxin exposure. The episode must also not be due to the direct physiological effects\n",
      "of a general medical condition (e.g., multiple sclerosis, brain tumor) (Criterion E).\n",
      "The elevated mood of a Manic Episode may be described as euphoric, unusually\n",

      "the person well. The expansive quality of the mood is characterized by unceasing and\n",
      "indiscriminate enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For\n",
      "example, the person may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in\n",
      "public places, or a salesperson may telephone strangers at home in the early morning\n",
      "hours to initiate sales. Although elevated mood is considered the prototypical symptom,\n",
      "the predominant mood disturbance may be irritability, particularly when the person's\n",

      "and inappropriate quality of the obsessions has been referred to as \"ego-dystonic.\" This\n",
      "refers to the individual's sense that the content of the obsession is alien, not within his\n",
      "or her own control, and not the kind of thought that he or she would expect to have.\n",
      "However, the individual is able to recognize that the obsessions are the product of his\n",
      "or her own mind and are not imposed from without (as in thought insertion).\n",
      "The most common obsessions are repeated thoughts about contamination (e.g.,\n",
      "becoming contaminated by shaking hands), repeated doubts (e.g., wondering whether\n",
      "one has performed some act such as having hurt someone in a traffic accident or having\n",
      "left a door unlocked), a need to have things in a particular order (e.g., intense distress\n",
      "when objects are disordered or asymmetrical), aggressive or horrific impulses (e.g., to\n",
      "hurt one's child or to shout an obscenity in church), and sexual imagery (e.g., a recurrent\n",

      "about real-life problems (e.g., concerns about current ongoing difficulties in life, such\n",
      "as financial, work, or school problems) and are unlikely to be related to a real-life\n",
      "problem.\n",
      "The individual with obsessions usually attempts to ignore or suppress such thoughts\n",
      "or impulses or to neutralize them with some other thought or action (i.e., a compulsion).\n",
      "For example, an individual plagued by doubts about having turned off the stove attempts\n",

      "prevent or reduce anxiety or distress, not to provide pleasure or gratification. In most\n",
      "cases, the person feels driven to perform the compulsion to reduce the distress that\n",
      "accompanies an obsession or to prevent some dreaded event or situation. For example,\n",

      "The diagnosis of Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder rests primarily on the clinical\n",

      "Individuals with Dependent Personality Disorder have great difficulty making\n",
      "everyday decisions (e.g., what color shirt to wear to work or whether to carry an\n",
      "umbrella) without an excessive amount of advice and reassurance from others (Criterion\n",
      "1). These individuals tend to be passive and to allow other people (often a single other\n",

      "where they should live, what kind of job they should have, and which neighbors to\n",
      "befriend. Adolescents with this disorder may allow their parent(s) to decide what they\n",
      "should wear, with whom they should associate, how they should spend their free time,\n",
      "and what school or college they should attend. This need for others to assume\n",
      "responsibility goes beyond age-appropriate and situation-appropriate requests for\n",
      "assistance from others (e.g., the specific needs of children, elderly persons, and\n",

      "When a close relationship ends (e.g., a breakup with a lover; the death of a\n",

      "flexibility, openness, and efficiency. This pattern begins by early adulthood and is present\n",

      "schedules, or form to the extent that the major point of the activity is lost (Criterion 1).\n",
      "They are excessively careful and prone to repetition, paying extraordinary attention to\n",
      "detail and repeatedly checking for possible mistakes. They are oblivious to the fact that\n",
      "other people tend to become very annoyed at the delays and inconveniences that result\n",
      "from this behavior. For example, when such individuals misplace a list of things to be\n",
      "done, they will spend an inordinate amount of time looking for the list rather than\n",
      "spending a few moments re-creating it from memory and proceeding to accomplish the\n",
      "tasks. Time is poorly allocated, the most important tasks being left to the last moment.\n",
      "The perfectionism and self-imposed high standards of performance cause significant\n",
      "dysfunction and distress in these individuals. They may become so involved in making\n",
      "every detail of a project absolutely perfect that the project is never finished (Criterion 2).\n",
      "For example, the completion of a written report is delayed by numerous time-consuming\n",
      "rewrites that all come up short of \"perfection.\" Deadlines are missed, and aspects of the\n",
      "individual's life that are not the current focus of activity may fall into disarray.\n",
      "Individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder display excessive\n",
      "devotion to work and productivity to the exclusion of leisure activities and friendships\n",
      "(Criterion 3). This behavior is not accounted for by economic necessity. They often feel\n",
      "that they do not have time to take an evening or a weekend day off to go on an outing\n",
      "or to just relax. They may keep postponing a pleasurable activity, such as a vacation,\n",
      "so that it may never occur. When they do take time for leisure activities or vacations,\n",

      "and they may be stiff in situations in which others would smile and be happy (e.g.,\n",

      "that whatever they say will be perfect. They may be preoccupied with logic and intellect,\n",
